- 👋 Hi, I’m @msharma1 a Cloud and Platorm Engineer focused on building scalable, automated infrastructure.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that can push my engineering skills on AI, AWS architecture, container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker), infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation), and using Python for automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, terraform-stack, serverless computing (Lambda/Fargate) and improving my skills in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack development, AI. cloud migration, DevOps best practices, or any open-source Python utility that solves a tricky automation problem.
